#   How to install Shellpop shell_to_meterpreter module into metasploit-framework
#   Obviously, you will need to have metasploit framework 4 installed in the
system. If you are smart then you're using Kali already and dont need to worry
with that.

root@kali# mkdir -p ~/.msf4/modules/post/shellpop
root@kali# cp extras/shell_to_meterpreter ~/.msf4/modules/post/shellpop

#   Now boot metasploit-framework (msfconsole) and you will find the module in 

post/shellpop/shell_to_meterpreter

#   With a command shell open, you can CTRL+Z (background) the shell and do
this procedure:

use post/shellpop/shell_to_meterpreter
set SESSION 1
set IS_POWERSHELL true  # if it is a powershell shell
run
#   This should upgrade your shell to meterpreter.

#   FAQ:
#  1. Why dont you use default module shell_to_meterpreter?
#  1A: It has some trouble into detecting PowerShell in some Windows Machines.
I find that very annoying. So it was far more easier to just set a Boolean
variable to skip PowerShell detection and just use it.
